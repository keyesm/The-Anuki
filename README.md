# The Anuki Game Design Project

This is a Game Design Project that we worked on as a team in our Game Design Class.

The game was developed using GDevelop

The goal is to get to the end of the game without dying from an enemy or falling off the platforms. You also need to beat the boss at the end of the last level to beat the game.
You get injured if you walk into an enemy. You have a health bar that determines how much health you have left.
