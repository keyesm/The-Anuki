# The Anuki Game Design Project

This is a Game Design Project that I worked on with a team in our Game Design Class.

The game was developed using GDevelop

I was the leader of the team and it is the first game that I have ever been a part of creating.

The goal is to get to the end of the game without dying from an enemy or falling off the platforms. You also need to beat the boss at the end of the last level to beat the game.
You get injured if you walk into an enemy. You have a health bar that determines how much health you have left.
